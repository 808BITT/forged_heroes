# Vision

## Project Overview

Forge (LLM Tool Specification Builder) is a dedicated application for creating, managing, and sharing tool specifications that extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our vision is to simplify the process of building function calling interfaces that allow LLMs to interact with external tools, APIs, and services.

## Mission Statement

To equip developers and AI enthusiasts with an intuitive platform for crafting well-defined tool specifications, enabling LLMs to perform more powerful and precise actions in the real world.

## Core Values

- **Simplicity**: Complex tasks should be made simple through thoughtful design
- **Flexibility**: Support for diverse tool specifications across various domains
- **Community**: Fostering collaboration through shared tools and best practices
- **Quality**: Ensuring precise, reliable tool specifications
- **Innovation**: Continuously evolving to support new LLM capabilities

## Target Audience

- AI developers working with LLMs
- Technical teams implementing AI solutions
- Researchers exploring LLM capabilities
- Organizations building custom AI tools
- Individuals experimenting with LLM function calling

## Key Objectives

1. Provide an intuitive visual interface for creating tool specifications
2. Support a wide range of parameter types and validation options
3. Facilitate organization and discovery of tool specifications
4. Enable testing and validation of tool specifications
5. Create a platform for sharing and collaboration
6. Support standard LLM function calling formats

## Long-term Vision

In the future, we envision Forge becoming:

- A central hub for discovering and sharing LLM tool specifications
- A platform with built-in integration to popular LLM providers
- A comprehensive toolset for managing the entire LLM tool lifecycle
- A community-driven resource for best practices in LLM tool design

## Success Criteria

- Intuitive user experience requiring minimal technical knowledge
- Comprehensive support for all common parameter types and validation options
- Reliable persistence and organization of tool specifications
- Active community of users sharing and improving tools
- Integration with major LLM platforms and frameworks

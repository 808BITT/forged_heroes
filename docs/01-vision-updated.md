# Vision

## Project Overview

**Llero** is an integrated platform for designing, deploying, and managing intelligent multi-agent AI workflows. It combines specialized modules into a cohesive developer experience. At its core, Llero helps developers create robust function-calling agents that extend Large Language Models (LLMs) into powerful task executors.

The platform is composed of five interconnected modules:

- **Forge** – Build JSON-based tool specifications for LLM function calling.
- **Barracks** – Manage "lleros," AI agents with tailored toolkits.
- **Academy** – Configure API keys and integration options for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- **Armory** – Explore, validate, and manage tools and their metadata.
- **Command Center** – Chat interface for orchestrating tools, agents, and LLM interactions.

Together, these modules form a monolithic web application that supports the full lifecycle of multi-agent AI systems.

## Mission Statement

To empower developers and AI teams with a unified platform that simplifies the creation, validation, and deployment of function-calling tools and intelligent agents—turning LLMs into real-world problem solvers.

## Core Values

- **Cohesion**: Unified workflow from tool creation to agent orchestration
- **Simplicity**: Visual-first design for managing complexity
- **Extendability**: Support for varied LLM providers and tool types
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into agent behavior and LLM calls
- **Community**: Encourage shared tools and open development practices

## Target Audience

- AI developers building custom agents and tools
- Technical teams managing internal LLM workflows
- Researchers testing function-calling use cases
- Organizations exploring intelligent automation
- Builders experimenting with agentic AI systems

## Key Objectives

1. Streamline the creation and validation of JSON-based function-calling tools
2. Support the configuration and reuse of external LLM providers
3. Enable users to define and manage agent roles and toolkits
4. Provide a real-time command interface to test and observe AI behavior
5. Offer intuitive ways to organize, explore, and share tools
6. Maintain compatibility with standard LLM APIs and formats

## Long-term Vision

Llero aims to become:

- A foundational toolkit for building next-generation AI agents
- A single pane of glass for managing agentic workflows and LLM integrations
- A knowledge-driven ecosystem where reusable tools and agents are shared, improved, and versioned
- A developer-first experience for testing and deploying LLM-backed workflows in production

## Success Criteria

- Low-friction interface for defining tools and agents
- Modular and scalable architecture supporting complex workflows
- Seamless integration with leading LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Rich telemetry and logging to observe agent behavior and tool usage
- Growing user base contributing tools, agents, and best practices

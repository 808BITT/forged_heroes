## Working Philosophy

- Every item in this list should break down into concrete GitHub issues/tasks.
- The current stage's top item is always the **next task**.
- If in doubt, return here and focus on the next bullet.

---

## Contribution Plans

This roadmap is for solo execution but designed to scale with future help. Once you onboard a collaborator:

- Each stage becomes a GitHub milestone
- Each bullet becomes a labeled issue or project card
- This doc becomes your strategic north star

Let‚Äôs build Llero‚Äîone focused task at a time.

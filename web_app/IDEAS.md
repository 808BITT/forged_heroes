# Currently Implemented

- Basic API endpoint to fetch tools from local storage
- Simple UI structure with root div
- Basic error handling in remote execution
- CLI tool specifications are being used but not fully utilized

## Areas for Improvement

### Enhanced User Interface (UI)

- Add proper routing support to create a more navigable interface
- Implement a header section with sign-in/sign-up functionality
- Add a command history feature
- Include loading states and error handling in UI components
- Consider adding a configuration panel
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for reordering parameters in the tool specification editor
- Add a visual representation of the tool specification schema to help users understand the structure
- Improve the overall design and user experience of the application with a more modern and intuitive interface
- Implement a dark mode for the UI

### API Endpoints

- Health check for the server
- User authentication/authorization endpoints
- Package installation via API
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Implement versioning for the API to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients
- Add detailed logging for API requests and responses for debugging and monitoring purposes
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance
- Add support for Swagger/OpenAPI to generate API documentation automatically

### Security Enhancements

- Implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Add proper request validation
- Consider rate limiting for API calls
- Add secure headers (e.g., Authorization: Bearer)
- Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted
- Implement input validation across API endpoints

### Configuration Management

- Move local storage to a more robust configuration system
- Add environment variables for sensitive configurations
- Implement proper secret management

### Documentation

- Add inline documentation comments explaining key features and APIs
- Create a basic API reference guide
- Add examples of using different tool specs

### Tool Specification Enhancements

- Implement a schema validation feature for tool specifications to ensure they adhere to a predefined structure
- Add support for different parameter types (e.g., integer, boolean, array, object) with appropriate validation
- Allow users to define dependencies between parameters (e.g., if parameter A is selected, parameter B becomes required)
- Implement a "test tool" feature that allows users to test their tool specification with sample inputs and see the expected output

### Code Quality and Structure

- Fix the missing import in tsconfig.json: import { app } from 'tsapp';
- Ensure all package dependencies are properly listed
- Consider adding proper error handling throughout the application
- Optimize image loading and minify CSS/JS where possible

### Performance Optimization

- Consider using a CDN for static assets to improve load times
- Implement proper compression for images
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., command execution)
- Minify CSS/JS files

### Security Best Practices

- Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted
- Implement input validation across API endpoints
- Add proper request validation
- Consider rate limiting for API calls

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- Add more comprehensive unit tests
- Set up a test server to test API endpoints
- Create integration tests for CLI tools
- Add proper error handling in all code paths

### Miscellaneous

- Implement a mechanism for exporting and importing tool specifications in JSON format
- Add a "duplicate tool" feature to easily create copies of existing tools
- Implement a search functionality to quickly find tools based on name, description, or parameters
